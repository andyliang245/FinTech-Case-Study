# **Plaid and Its Mission to "Democratizing Financial Services Through Technology"**

## ***Overview and Origin***

### Plaid, a San Francisco based company, is a technology company, and home of 600+ employees, that develops a network of data transfer designed to assist FinTech companies to connect their finance products (such mobile applications) with consumers' traditional banking accounts. In doing so, Plaid makes it simple and safer for developers to build innovative FinTech products, from small startup companies all the way to the largest financial institutions. The company was founded in 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey, whom at the time were collaborating in an attempt to build and provide financial management products to direct consumers. The pair then pivoted company's direction to financial infrastructure and shifted its focus to unified banking API. Thanks to its pivot to enterprise solutions, Plaid was able to raise its recognition and receive funding to continue its business operations.

### In 2013, Plaid received its seeding round funding of $2.8 million led by Spark Capital with additional participants from Google Venture, New Enterprise Associates, Felicis Ventures, and  Homebrew Capital. After securing its seeding round fundings, Plaid had raised three more rounds of capital in aggregate of $306.5 million. New Enterprise Associates led the comapny's Series A funding, totalling to approximately $12.5 million in 2014. Goldman Sachs and others participated in Plaid's Series B funding in 2016 as the company raised roughly $44 million. The latest round of funding (Series C) tallied to $250 million led by Mary Meeker, putting the company's valuation at approximately $2.65 billion in 2018.

## ***Business Activities***

### Historically, in order to make any financial transactions, the process of allowing third party vendors such as mortgage lenders to access consumers' banking information for payments has been an arduous process. By utilizing Plaid's infrastructure, it allows third party vendors to access consumers' banking information (with consumers' consent) and eliminating all the bottleneck proceeses. Plaid's core business is to take the most of the bank's main functionality, bundle in a set of APIs, and deliver that to consumers on-the-go.

>"Plaid makes it easy to set up ACH transfers from any bank or credit union in the U.S. Once a user links their account via their banking credentials, Plaid retrieves their account and routing numbers. ACH payments can be set up in moments."

### Plaid's target customers are FinTech developers looking to build financial services application that would impact direct consumers. This can range from payment solution players such as Venmo, investment management companies such as Robinhood, Lending institutions/mortgages, etc. Once integrated with consumer authentication, Plaid can instantly match user-provided account, automate micro-deposits which are automatically verified on behalf of the users, and provide same day micro-deposits for users to verify within 1 business day, thus eliminating the process of going to the bank physically with tedious procedures to provide authentication (ID, birth certificate, etc.).

### In 2019, the Global FinTech Market was valued at approximately $5.504 billion, with the CAGR of roughly 24%. This presents a huge opportunity for Plaid as it continues to expand its customer base from start-up companies to potentially government entities.

## ***Landscape***

### Plaid may seem to be under the umbrella of payment solutions. However, since the company offers its technology infrastructures to developers and enterprises, Plaid falls in the domain of enterprise solution. For start-ups or small developers, Plaid's products and services offer a blueprint to produce "the next big thing" in the financial services industry. As institutions dab their feets into the water of Financial Technologies industry, the trend is to use vendors like Plaid as a starting guide to build out their own technologies to connect with consumers' banking information through consent. It is cost-effective and allows these larger enterprises to focus on other ever-evolving financial solutions to maintain its status and compete with others in the same industry.

### As a financial data aggregator, Plaid faces a few competitions in the market. Yodlee was dubbed as "the OG financial data aggregator." Through its veteran leadership since 1999, Yodlee is one of the leading financial data aggregators that presents a huge threat to Plaid. While the competition is fierce, Plaid's main competitive advantage is its developer friendliness on its API infrastructure and offers guides and sample applications to allow the developers to easily navigate while building their own FinTech products.

## ***Results***

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?



## ***Recommendations***

### Since the company thrive on unified banking APIs to help developers create applications to assist consumers linking banking information, Plaid can utilize the similar methodology build an infrastrucure that allow developers to use its product to develop applications which can simplify consumers' need to retrieving sensitive financial information such as tax documentations. This will then expand Plaid's customer base to boutique accounting firms, bigger tax-return filing organizations such as H&R Block and Turbo Tax, and even government agencies such as Internal Revenues Service agency during tax seasons. As the company builds more infrastructures outside of unified banking APIs, it can then translate into additional market opportunity with unified tax information APIs.
