# **Plaid and Its Mission to Democratizing Financial Services Through Technology**

## ***Overview and Origin***

#### Plaid, a San Francisco based company, is a technology company that develops a network of data transfer designed to assist financial technologe (aka FinTech) companies to connect their finance products (mobile applications) with consumers' traditional banking accounts. In doing so, Plaid makes it simple and safer for developers to build innovative FinTech products, from small startup companies all the way to the largest financial institutions. The company was founded in 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey, whom at the time were collaborating in an attempt to build and provide financial management products to direct consumers. The pair then pivoted company's direction to financial infrastructure and shifted its focus to unified banking API. Plaid received its seeding round funding of $2.8 million in 2013 led by Spark Capital with additional participants from Google Venture, New Enterprise Associates, Felicis Ventures, and  Homebrew Capital. After Plaid received its seeding round funding, it had raised 3 more rounds of capital in the total of $306.5 million, with the latest round of funding (Series C) at $250 million, putting the company's valuation at approximately $2.5 billion in 2018.
